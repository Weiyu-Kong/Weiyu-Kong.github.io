Hello ! 🙂

I am a first-year Master’s student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), where I am fortunate to be part of the [CoPhi](http://linyun.info/team.html) research group under the guidance of [Prof. Yun Lin](http://linyun.info). Prior to this, I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University.

My research interests revolve around the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on visualizing deep learning training processes and leveraging large models to assist software engineering tasks.
