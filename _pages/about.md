<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Master‚Äôs student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Department of Computer Science, where I am fortunate to be part of the [CoPhi](http://linyun.info/team.html) research group under the guidance of [Prof. Yun Lin](http://linyun.info). Prior to this, I graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University.
My research interests revolve around the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on visualizing deep learning training processes and leveraging large models to assist software engineering tasks.
